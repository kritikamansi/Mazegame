# 2D Maze Game

A console-based 2D maze game implemented in C++ featuring object-oriented design, multiple levels, collectibles, enemies, and file I/O functionality.

## 🎮 Game Features

### Core Gameplay
- **10x10 Grid Maze**: Navigate through a maze using a 2D array structure
- **Player Character (P)**: Move through the maze to reach the exit
- **Exit Goal (E)**: Reach the exit to complete each level
- **Wall Collision**: Solid walls (#) block movement
- **Multiple Levels**: 5 progressively difficult levels

### Interactive Elements
- **Collectible Items (*)**: Collect for bonus points
- **Moving Enemies (X)**: Avoid randomly moving enemies
- **Score System**: Track points from collectibles
- **Move Counter**: Monitor your efficiency

### Advanced Features
- **Multiple Save/Load System**: 5 save slots available, startup menu for loading games
- **Progressive Difficulty**: More enemies and collectibles on higher levels
- **Game Over Conditions**: Collision with enemies ends the game
- **Level Progression**: Complete levels to advance

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls
- **W** - Move Up
- **A** - Move Left
- **S** - Move Down
- **D** - Move Right
- **Q** - Quit Game
- **R** - Restart Current Level
- **N** - Next Level (when level is completed)
- **P** - Save Menu (choose from 5 save slots)
- **L** - Load Menu (choose from 5 save slots)

### Game Objective
1. Navigate your player (P) through the maze
2. Collect items (*) to increase your score
3. Avoid enemies (X) - touching them ends the game
4. Reach the exit (E) to complete the level
5. Progress through all 5 levels to win

### Game Elements
| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| # | Wall (impassable) |
| P | Player |
| E | Exit |
| * | Collectible Item |
| X | Enemy |
| (space) | Open Path |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Class Structure
The game uses object-oriented design with inheritance:

- **Entity (Base Class)**: Common functionality for all game objects
- **Player**: Handles movement, scoring, and collision detection
- **Enemy**: Random movement AI and collision
- **Collectible**: Items that can be collected for points
- **Maze**: 2D grid management and file I/O
- **Game**: Main game loop, state management, and rendering

- ✅ Comprehensive code comments
- ✅ Detailed README.md documentation

## 🔧 Compilation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++11 support (g++, clang++, or MSVC)
- Make utility (optional, for using Makefile)

### Building the Game

#### Option 1: Using Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the game
make

# Build and run
make run

# Build debug version
make debug

# Build release version
make release

# Clean build files
make clean

# Show help
make help
```

#### Option 2: Manual Compilation
```bash
# Compile all source files
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 main.cpp Entity.cpp Player.cpp Enemy.cpp Collectible.cpp Maze.cpp Game.cpp -o maze_game

# Run the game
./maze_game
```

### Running the Game
After successful compilation:
```bash
./maze_game
```

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Scoring System
- **Collectible Items**: 10 points × current level
- **Level Completion**: Bonus for reaching exit
- **Move Efficiency**: Lower move count = better performance

### Difficulty Progression
Each level increases difficulty by:
- Adding more enemies (up to 3)
- Increasing collectible count
- More complex maze layouts
- Faster enemy movement

### Enemy AI
- Enemies move randomly every few game ticks
- Movement frequency increases with level difficulty
- Enemies cannot move through walls
- Collision with player causes game over

### Save/Load System
- **5 Save Slots**: Each slot creates a separate save file (`maze_save_1.txt` to `maze_save_5.txt`)
- **Startup Menu**: Choose to start new game or load from any save slot
- **In-Game Saving**: Press P during gameplay to save to any slot
- **In-Game Loading**: Press L during gameplay to load from any slot
- **Persistent**: Save files remain between game sessions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compilation Errors:**
- Ensure C++11 support: Add `-std=c++11` flag
- On Windows: May need to adjust include paths for console I/O

**Runtime Issues:**
- **Input not responsive**: Game uses non-blocking input
- **Screen not clearing**: Terminal may not support clear commands

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Windows:**
- Uses `conio.h` for input handling
- Uses `system("cls")` for screen clearing

**Linux/macOS:**
- Uses `termios.h` for input handling
- Uses `system("clear")` for screen clearing

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Pathfinding AI for enemies
- [ ] Power-ups and special items
- [ ] Time-based challenges
- [ ] High score persistence
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Graphics interface
- [ ] Network multiplayer
- [ ] Level editor
